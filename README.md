# fastai-turtle-classifier
An image classifier for turtles based on the first two lessons of the 2020 fast.ai course

* The Jupyter notebook `02_production_COPY` is chapter 2 of the 2020 fast.ai course, on which the project is based. I will be closely following the steps laid out in that chapter to build a classifier to tell a few types of turtles apart.
